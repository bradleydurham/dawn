Remove any caulk from the metal surface, as adhesive will not stick to caulk.<\/p><p>2. Clean the area thoroughly with rubbing or denatured alcohol using a microfiber cloth. <\/p><p>3. To avoid a residue that will prevent the wrap from adhering to your surface, do not use household cleaning products. Especially avoid products that contain ammonia or degreasers.<\/p><p>Installation <\/p><p>1. Begin with the back panel, if your wrap has a back, and peel 5”- 6” of liner down from the top edge of the wrap panel. Add a crease in the liner  to keep it  away from the adhesive.<\/p><p>2. Align the wrap at the top edge of the back panel, making sure it is straight. <\/p><p>3. Press along the top edge of the wrap, securing it in place. Readjust the alignment, if needed, before continuing.<\/p><p>4. Press across and downward, making sure to work out any air bubbles, as you go. Reposition and make adjustments as needed. (The back panel wrap may have small sections that extend around corners to the side panels.) <\/p><p>5. Pull away manageable sections of the liner as you go. Do not remove large sections, as the adhesive may stick to unintended materials and surfaces. <\/p><p>6. After smoothing the wrap across and down the panel, firmly press all edges again for security. <\/p><p>7. Repeat the process for all sides. <br\/><\/p><p>PRO TIPS:<\/p><ul><li>Install in a dry environment.
